# ToucanTech-Test

The ToucanTech database stores information about its members. Each member can be associated with 1 or more school.

Please build a demo that allows someone to add a new member with the fields “Name”, “Email Address” and "School" (selected from a list). The demo should display all members for a selected school.

The primary language we use is PHP and we use an MVC framework so please use this in your coding test.

We will want to run and connect to your code on our own machines so if there are any unusual pre-requisites please document them.

Please treat this as a serious piece of code and apply best practices. This code is being written for others to scrutinise - if you are selected for interview you will be asked about it.

We will be assessing your program and database design. Code re-use, extensibility and maintenance are all important.
